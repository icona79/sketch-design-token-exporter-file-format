# File Format Project Template

This is a template for a file format project, with a few basic features and sensible defaults.

## Setup

Optional, if you use `nvm` (highly recommended):

```bash
nvm install 17.8.0
nvm use # if you're using Codespaces, you'll need to run `nvm use --delete-prefix`
```

Install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

and run the project:

```bash
npm start
```
